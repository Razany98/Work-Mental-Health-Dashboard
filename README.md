# 🧠 Work and Mental Health Dashboard

This project analyzes how remote work impacts mental health using a global dataset. The goal is to help organizations understand the prevalence and causes of issues like anxiety, depression, and burnout, and propose solutions to support employee well-being.

## 📌 Overview

- 📊 Dataset: [Remote Work & Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health/data)
- 🛠 Tools Used:
    - Python: Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)
    - Tableau: Interactive dashboard
    - Excel: Initial data review

### 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed gender entries marked as "non-binary" or "prefer not to say" (to focus on binary gender analysis).
- Inferred missing `Mental_Health_Condition` values using related columns like:
  - Social isolation rating
  - Stress level
  - Remote work status
  - Work-life balance
  - Productivity change
- Filled missing physical activity values with the most common value.
- Removed outliers, standardized categorical variables, and validated experience vs age.
